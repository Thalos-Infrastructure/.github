# Thalos

Thalos is a trustless escrow infrastructure designed to bring security, clarity, and reliability to digital work agreements. 

---

## Overview

Digital collaboration has grown exponentially, but trust mechanisms have not evolved at the same pace. Payments are often based on informal agreements, screenshots, or blind upfront transfers. This creates friction, disputes, and financial risk for both sides.

Thalos solves this problem by introducing programmable, trust-minimized escrow agreements powered by Trustless Work technology. Instead of relying on personal trust or centralized intermediaries, funds are secured under transparent and verifiable rules. Payments are released only when agreed conditions are met.

Our goal is to make digital agreements as secure as they are simple.

---

## Vision

To become the foundational trust infrastructure for digital work worldwide.

We envision a future where remote collaboration, freelance work, and global partnerships operate without fear of non-payment, fraud, or ambiguity — where trust is embedded directly into the system.

---

## Mission

To empower individuals and organizations to work together safely by:

- Providing programmable escrow agreements.
- Reducing counterparty risk in digital transactions.
- Making trustless financial tools accessible to non-technical users.
- Designing intuitive experiences on top of secure blockchain infrastructure.

---

## How Thalos Works

1. Two parties define the scope and conditions of a job.
2. Funds are deposited into a secure escrow contract.
3. The system holds funds under predefined rules.
4. Payment is released automatically when conditions are fulfilled.

This approach removes uncertainty while preserving fairness and transparency.

Under the hood, Thalos leverages Trustless Work technology to ensure that the logic governing escrow agreements cannot be arbitrarily altered and does not depend on centralized control.

## Core Principles

- Security First: Funds must always be protected by transparent and enforceable logic.
- Simplicity: Advanced infrastructure should feel intuitive and accessible.
- Neutrality: The system should protect both parties equally.
- Scalability: Designed to support the future of remote and borderless work.

## Product Focus

- Customizable escrow agreements.
- Drag-and-drop escrow configuration (wizard-based UX).
- Mobile-responsive experience.
- Secure blockchain-backed settlement logic.
